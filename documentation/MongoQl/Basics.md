This page gives a basic overview of the MongoDB Query Language implementation used by Polypheny.

## Introduction

The MongoDB Query Language used in Polypheny strongly follows the standard given by MongoDB v. 4.4. 
Using it, one is able to query a document schema as well as a relational one to an extent.
While a lot of functionality of the language are mapped to Polypheny, some is not available due to different factors.

## Document Keys/References

Keys used in documents need to be enclosed in double quotes ( " ).
