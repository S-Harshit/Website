This page gives a basic overview of the MongoDB Query Language adaptation used by Polypheny.

## Introduction

The MongoDB Query Language used in Polypheny strongly follows the standard given by MongoDB v. 4.4. 
Using it, one is able to query a document schema as well as a relational one to an extent.
While a lot of functionality of the language are mapped to Polypheny, some is not available due to different factors.

## Document Keys/References

Keys and references need to be enclosed in double quotes (`"`). 

## Work In Progress
The MongoDB Query Language documentation is heavily worked on at the movement, which means that parts can change without warning in the future.
Additionally, there are still undocumented functionality, which will be added during this process.
